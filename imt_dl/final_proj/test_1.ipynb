I recommend this product if you are not worried about having a lot accessories to go with it, because they are not that many available.\n",

It is supposed to come completely put together, but when it arrived, there were no less than 10 little parts that had come off the screen assembly and one screen that was loose and all of its parts dangling. The first thing that happenned is that I cut myself on one of the screens because the protective side had come off. I was bleeding for quite some time. The second thing I noticed was the extremely poor quality of the material and assembly. I am very handy by nature, but even I had to give up trying to put this piece of junk back together again. Plus it was not worth it, even if I had put it together again, all I would have then had was a piece of crap fireplace screen.\n",

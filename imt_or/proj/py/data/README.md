# DATA FILES Descriptions:

1_ga_st_NOhybrids_methods_study.pkl
To start studying the behavior of hte different methods and the configuraion percentage assigned for crossover and mutation. No usage of hybird.

2_ga_st_hyout_hyin_hynone.pkl
Once defined the configuration, we studied the hybrid approaches: inside or outside the GA.

3_ga_st_repeat_conf_300_smalldata.pkl
Having the configuration of our final algorithm, did some repetitions (300) to understand tendencies.

4_ga_st_repeat_conf_20_smalldata.pkl
Tested if we could trust in a 20 runs limit for the GA

5_ga_st_repeat_conf_50_largedata.pkl
Started tests with large data and see what happened for large amount of repetitions (50)

6_pop_100_small.pkl
7_pop_200_small.pkl
8_pop_300_small.pkl
See how population affected results

9_ga_st_2000_pop_largedata.pkl
See the difference with other quantities of population

10_pop_2050_large.pkl
Increased the iterations limitations to test (40)

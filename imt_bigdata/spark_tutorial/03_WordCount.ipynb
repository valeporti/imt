    "# 03: WordCount - Alternative Implementations of WordCount\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise also implements *Word Count*, but it uses a slightly simpler approach. It also shows one way to make the code more configurable. We'll define variables for the input and output locations. The corresponding Spark program, [WordCount3.scala](https://github.com/deanwampler/spark-scala-tutorial/blob/master/src/main/scala/sparktutorial/WordCount3.scala) uses a utility library to support command-line arguments. (The library demonstrates some idiomatic, but fairly advanced Scala code, but you can ignore the details and just use it.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, instead of using the old approach of creating a `SparkContext`, like we did in <a href=\"02_WordCount.ipynb\" target=\"02_WC\">02_WordCount</a>, we'll use the now recommended approach of creating a `SparkSession` and extracting the `SparkContext` from it when needed. Finally, we'll also use [Kryo Serialization](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/tuning.html), which provides better compression and therefore better utilization of memory and network bandwidth (not that we really need it for this small dataset...).\n",
    "\n",
    "This version also does some data cleansing to improve the results. The sacred text files included in the `data` directory, such as `kjvdat.txt` are actually formatted records of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "book|chapter#|verse#|text\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, pipe-separated fields with the book of the Bible (e.g., Genesis, but abbreviated \"Gen\"), the chapter and verse numbers, and then the verse text. We just want to count words in the verses, although including the book names wouldn't change the results significantly. (Now you can figure out the answer to one of the exercises in the previous example...)"
